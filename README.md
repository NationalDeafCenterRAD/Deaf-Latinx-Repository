The National Deaf Center on Postsecondary Outcomes' 2021 Deaf Latinx report aims to understand which aspects of employment experiences might be unique, or not, to the deaf Latinx population. The report's analyses are based on this repository, which contains the R syntax for all statistical assessments, thereby enabling the public to reproduce or update the results. However, in so doing, 13 Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) datasets from 1-year estimates and 2 datasets of 5-year estimates from American Community Survey (ACS) are required.

## How To Start <a id = 'start'></a>

The prerequisite for conducting all assessments is at least 51 GB of memory space. The computer needs to either have this amount of storage available or create additional space. Without sufficient memory, these assessments cannot be performed.

1. The first step in this process is to clone the repository by using the ```git clone``` command.

2. All of these datasets can be obtained from the [U.S. Census Bureau's File Transfer Protocol](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/).

3. The most recent PUMS csv_hus.zip and csv_pus.zip datasets of 5-year estimates need to be downloaded and put in the [Assets](Assets) folder.
   
4. The 13 consecutive PUMS csv_pus.zip datasets of 1-year estimates need to be downloaded and put in the [Time Assets](Time Assets)
